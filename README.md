# P436-Operating_Systems
My work from my operating systems course at IU Bloomington taken spring 2023.

The goal for this course was to gain a more complete understanding of modern OS design by building our own feautres on top of a small xinu kernel. Below I have included a short list of highlights. Boilerplate and support code was provided by the professor to allow us to focus on concepts, but is excluded from the list. All files highlighted below were written by me.

#### idelgass-master/system
- future.c
- heap.c

#### idelgass-master/apps
- future_prodcons.c
- produce_bb.c
- consume_bb.c

#### idelgass-master/shell
- xsh_prodcons.c
- xsh_run.c
- xsh_prodcons_bb.c
