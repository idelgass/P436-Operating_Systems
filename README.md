# P436-Operating_Systems
My work from my operating systems course at IU Bloomington taken spring 2023.

The goal for this course was to gain a more complete understanding of modern OS design by building our own feautres on top of a small xinu kernel. Some boilerplate and support code was provided by the professor to allow us to focus on concepts. Most of the substantive code that I wrote can be found in system/platorm and apps.
